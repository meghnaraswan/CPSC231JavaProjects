- ZyBook for definitions of certain terms
- ZyLab 7.22 for referencing the blueprint of the NutritionalInfo and FoodItem classes see how to construct a class
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-50/ for the definition and understanding of default constructors
- I worked together on the StudentRecod.java program with Isabella Sills, who is in Dr. Steven's class, for help on how to do the equals method. We both used Dr. Steven's Dog.java classwork program as a reference to understand how to do the equals method.
